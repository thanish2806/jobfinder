        content: `Prompt engineering is the art of designing input queries to optimize the performance of language models like GPT.

🧠 Why it matters:
- Improves the quality, relevance, and safety of AI responses
- Helps control model behavior

Applications:
- Chatbots
- Code generation
- Content creation
- Semantic search

        content: `Understanding how LLMs process text helps us write better prompts.

🔍 Key Concepts:
- Tokenization (models see tokens, not words)
- Context window (limited memory, e.g., 8k tokens)
- Attention mechanisms focus on prompt details

🧪 Prompt Sensitivity:
- Small changes = big output differences
- Use precise and unambiguous phrasing

\`\`\`txt
Bad: "Tell me something."
Better: "List 3 facts about Mars."

Translate English to French:
- Dog -> Chien
- Cat -> Chat
- House -> ?
\`\`\`

🧪 Zero-shot:
No examples; just an instruction:
"Translate 'house' to French."

Use Cases:
- Few-shot: Improved control for creative or complex tasks
- Zero-shot: Faster, works for clear instructions

Q: If there are 3 apples and you eat 1, how many are left?
A: Let's think step by step.
There were 3 apples. I ate 1. So 3 - 1 = 2 apples left.
